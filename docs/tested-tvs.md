# Tested TVs

Confirmed on 39 TVs across 26 series so far (webOS 3.4 through 26). Other rooted models should work.

Sizes and regional variants of one series run the same software, so the table below has one row per series. Years are LG's model years; many TVs have since been updated to a later webOS.

The Luna service names and `/proc/lg` paths this relies on may differ across webOS versions and panel types.

**Tested on another model?** Please [open an issue](https://github.com/rorygallagher2024/glasshouse/issues/new) with the TV model, webOS version, and the contents of `/var/lib/tvweb/tvweb.log` — whether everything worked or something broke — and we will add a row.
