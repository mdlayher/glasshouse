# Prometheus metrics

[Prometheus](https://prometheus.io/) is an open-source time-series monitoring and alerting platform. Rather than waiting for systems to push events, Prometheus periodically scrapes metrics over HTTP from instrumented endpoints, storing timestamped samples that can be queried with PromQL and visualized in dashboards like [Grafana](https://grafana.com/).

In Glasshouse, the Prometheus metrics endpoint exposes your TV's system, panel, and HDMI telemetry directly to Prometheus-compatible scrapers (including VictoriaMetrics and Grafana Agent). Common use-cases include:

* **Long-term OLED panel and storage health:** Graphing panel run-time against automatic pixel refresher cycles in Grafana to monitor panel aging, verify that compensation cycles run after prolonged sessions, and track eMMC flash wear over the life of the TV.
* **Thermal and hardware observability:** Recording SoC temperatures, processor clocks, and memory utilization over time to identify thermal throttling, background spikes, or resource constraints during high-bitrate 4K HDR playback and gaming.
* **Proactive home lab alerting:** Setting Alertmanager alert rules to trigger notifications when Magic Remote battery levels drop below 15%, when internal storage approaches capacity, when eMMC enters pre-EOL warning states, or if panel maintenance errors occur.
* **Infrastructure monitoring without Home Assistant:** Collecting rich telemetry directly into an existing monitoring and observability stack without requiring an MQTT broker or Home Assistant instance.

The server answers scrapes at `/api/prometheus/metrics` in the standard Prometheus text exposition format. It is off by default, and while it is off the path does not exist: a request receives a `404 Not Found`.

## Switching it on

The **Prometheus** switch on the [Server tab](dashboard/server.md) turns it on and off, at once and without a restart. It is read-only where controls are turned off in `config.json`.

The same setting can be configured in `/var/lib/tvweb/config.json` on the TV, followed by a restart of the server:

```json
"prometheus": { "enabled": true }
```

## Scraping

The endpoint is under `/api/`, so a [token](SECURITY.md), where one is set, is needed as for the rest of the API. Prometheus sends it as an `Authorization: Bearer` header, which keeps it out of URLs and logs:

```yaml
scrape_configs:
  - job_name: glasshouse
    metrics_path: /api/prometheus/metrics
    scrape_interval: 15s
    authorization:
      credentials_file: /etc/prometheus/glasshouse-token
    static_configs:
      - targets: ["192.168.1.20:8080"]
```

Each scrape runs the same stats collection as the dashboard, behind its 1.5 s cache, so 15 s is the recommended minimum scrape interval. At that rate it costs about the same as the MQTT bridge's 10 s publish.

## Testing locally

To spin up a local Prometheus instance against your TV without manual setup:

```bash
./scripts/run-prometheus.sh <tv-ip> [<tv-ip2> ...]
```

It downloads a standalone Prometheus binary into `~/.cache/glasshouse-prometheus/` if one is not in PATH, starts a server targeting your TV(s) at `http://localhost:9090`, and cleans up its temporary state when stopped.

## Metrics

These names are stable: one is not renamed or removed, so dashboards and alerts built on them keep working. Labels carry only values that rarely change. Values are in base units: bytes, hertz, seconds, and ratios from 0 to 1 rather than percentages. A family the TV gives no reading for, such as the panel figures on an LCD or the remote's battery with no remote paired, is left out of the scrape, HELP and TYPE too, rather than given a 0.

The OLED protections are `asbl`, the Automatic Static Brightness Limiter (Temporal Peak Control on the TV), which lowers brightness while a bright image is held, and `gsr`, Global Stress Reduction, which dims the screen when it detects a stationary element. They come from the TV's panel service, or from its panel maintenance records where it has none; a TV that reports neither has no sample for them.

`glasshouse_signal_info` labels the picture settings in use: `dynamic_range` is `sdr`, `hdr`, `dolby_vision` or `technicolor`, and `picture_mode` is the mode within it: `personalized`, `vivid`, `standard`, `eco`, `cinema`, `cinema_bright`, `sports`, `game`, `photo`, `filmmaker`, `expert_bright`, `expert_dark` or `hdr_effect`. A value the TV adds later keeps its own name in snake case.

`glasshouse_sound_info` labels the sound settings, the output and mode the dashboard's and Home Assistant's selects show, rather than the audio path in use at the moment. `output` is the output's key, such as `tv_speaker`, `external_arc`, `external_optical`, `bt_soundbar`, `headphone`, or `tv_external_speaker`, and `mode` is `standard`, `ai_sound`, `ai_sound_plus`, `movie`, `news`, `sports`, `music`, or `game`. A value the TV adds later keeps its own name in snake case. `glasshouse_volume_ratio` has a sample only while the TV sets the volume level: with an output whose volume it only steps, such as an ARC soundbar, or does not control, such as optical, it has no level to report.

The signal gauges describe the HDMI source on screen and have no sample otherwise. The refresh rate is the rate the source sends, not the content's frame rate. `glasshouse_signal_frame_rate_hertz` is the rate the game is running at while VRR is in use, and the same as the refresh rate otherwise. Its `vrr_type` label is the kind of VRR, such as `gsync`, or `off`.

`glasshouse_signal_format_info` and the HDR families describe the source on the TV's connected video sink and have no sample without one. `type` is the source's HDR type, such as `sdr` or `hdr10`, with player-led (low-latency) Dolby Vision as `dolby_vision_low_latency`; `eotf` is `sdr`, `hdr`, `pq`, or `hlg`, from the source's HDR static metadata, and empty without it; `colorimetry` is the colorimetry the source signals, such as `bt2020_rgb_or_ycbcr`; and `encoding` is `rgb_444`, `ycbcr_444`, `ycbcr_422`, or `ycbcr_420`, named as the HDMI link's `chroma` is. A value the TV adds later keeps its own name in snake case. The HDR luminance gauges are in nits (cd/m²), from HDR10 static metadata, and the content and frame-average light levels have no sample while the source gives none.

`glasshouse_signal_low_latency` is ALLM, the flag an HDMI source sets to ask for the TV's low-latency picture processing, in any format. Low-latency Dolby Vision is separate: the source does the Dolby Vision mapping and sends a BT.2020 signal, and `type` is `dolby_vision_low_latency`, where Dolby Vision the TV maps is `dolby_vision`. `dynamic_range` is `dolby_vision` in both, so only `type` tells them apart, and neither implies ALLM.

The HDMI link families describe every input with a source linked to it, whichever input is on screen, and have no sample for an input without one; `glasshouse_hdmi_source_powered` has a sample for every input, linked or not. `input` is `hdmi1` to `hdmi4`, as the TV numbers its inputs. `phy_mode` is `frl_48`, `frl_40`, `frl_32`, `frl_24`, `frl_18`, `frl_9`, `tmds_6g`, or `tmds_3g`, and `other` for a mode outside these, which has no rate; `chroma` is `rgb_444`, `ycbcr_444`, `ycbcr_422`, or `ycbcr_420`; and `hdcp` is `2_3`, `2_2`, `1_4`, or `none`. A chroma format or HDCP version outside these keeps its own name in snake case.

`glasshouse_foreground_app_info` has a sample while an app is in the foreground, including with the screen off, and none in standby: `app_id` is the app's id, such as `com.webos.app.hdmi4` or `netflix`, and `app_name` is the name given an input in the TV's settings, an app's title, or the short id. `glasshouse_hdmi_input_info` has a sample for every HDMI input, labelled with `input`, its `app_id`, and the `name` given it in the TV's settings, so the foreground app joins it on `app_id` and the input then joins the HDMI link families on `input`.

The syslog counters count since the server started and have samples only while [syslog forwarding](IMPLEMENTATION.md#forwarding-the-logs-to-syslog) is on. `source` is `system`, `glasshouse`, or `kernel`, one for each source forwarded. Compared with what the receiver counts per `source` as MSGID, they show lines lost on the way.

`version` is the Glasshouse version. A label the TV does not report is present with an empty value. The panel usage since the last compensation cycle is `glasshouse_oled_panel_usage_seconds_total - glasshouse_oled_last_compensation_usage_seconds`, the uptime is `time() - glasshouse_boot_time_seconds`, and the processor's busy share is `1 - avg without (cpu, mode) (rate(glasshouse_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}[5m]))`.
